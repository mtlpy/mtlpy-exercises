# mtlpy-exercises

Montr√©al-Python exercises used in various events such as workshops or exercise evenings.

## Exercises

The exercises themselves are hosted on Google Drive
* `ipynb` files used in Colab are more easily maintained directly on Google Drive than versioned in GitHub

See [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JVUg2I-OngEjiwz_DwtGiv5Cxs7-LnCZ?usp=sharing) for the exercises.

## Data

This repo is used as a convenient way to host the datasets required for the exercises.
* GitHub URLs are more semantic than Google Drive one

Each exercise has its own directory.
